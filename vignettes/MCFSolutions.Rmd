# Overview

Optmatch finds optimal matches by translating them to min-cost flow problems (Rosenbaum, 1991, JRSS-B; Hansen and Klopfer, 2006, JCGS), relying on a min-cost flow solver that works by dual ascent.
Through 2018 (version 0.9*), no attempt was made to store the dual problem solution found by this solver; accordingly, it was not possible to use that solution as a starting value for related matching problems.  This document lays out a roadmap for "daylighting" the min-cost flow material, i.e. making it accessible to the R user, for warm starts and supplementary calculations.




## Proximate goals

1.  When solver saw a discretized version of the distance, check whether solution is optimal for matching problem w/ double precision distance (by checking whether primal solution and back-transformed dual solution stand in CS relation to one another). (Cf. issue 160.)
2. Warm starts for MCF problems deriving from same double-precision distance but w/ a different discretization. (Cf. issue 76.)
3. Use dual solution to one problem as warm start for another problem with same arcs, arc costs as in original problem but adding new arcs (between existing nodes).
4. Use dual solution to one problem as warm start for another problem with same arcs and arc costs, but adding new "downstream" nodes and new arcs connecting them to existing "upstream" nodes.



## Maybe-later goals

- Flexibly combine subproblem solutions (e.g., distributing subproblems across different cores before combining).
- Merge dual solutions of distinct subproblems, arriving at a possible starting value for a combined subproblem.
- supercede optmatch s3 class, methods with an S4 class, methods.
- Use the dual solution as a basis for computing maxErr / exceedance.

# Classes

## Subproblems / `SubProbInfo`

An `SubProbInfo` is an S4-typed data frame bearing information about (sub)problems passed to the solver, and their translation to and from units acceptable to the solver. Columns:

- `groups`, character (which subproblem?);
- `flipped`, logical (do upstream nodes of MCF representation correspond to _columns_ of match distance matrix, as opposed to rows, the default?);
- `hashed_dist`, character (hashed ID for a double precision distance);
- `resolution`, double  (grid-width for discretization of distances & node prices before rounding and handing off to solver);
-  `primal_value`, numeric (as determined by back-transformed node prices, arc costs and arc flows);
-  `dual_value`, numeric (as determined by back-transformed node prices and arc costs);
- `feasible`, logical;
- `exceedance`, double (the legacy criterion regret calculation).

Rules/conventions:

- this is just a selective record of subproblem specs.
- This type's validity checker should be fast, eschewing expensive operations.
- `feasible` encodes whether the flow-price pair was found to be in a complementary slackness relationship, prior to backtransformation of distances & prices (if applicable).  In other words, `feasible==FALSE` indicates that the subproblem imposed infeasible matching constraints.
- "Upstream" nodes are those to the left in the below diagram (Fig. 2 of Hansen & Klopfer, 2006).  Ordinarily they'll correspond to "the treatment group", i.e. the group indexed by rows of the distance matrix helping to determine the matching problem, but in some situations rows and columns are flipped before being passed to the solver, so that upstream nodes would correspond to columns and downstream nodes to rows.

### `NodeInfo` & subclasses

A `NodeInfo` is an S4-typed data frame bearing a
non-null `row.names` attribute and columns:

- `name`, character;
- `price`, double or integer (node prices);
- `upstream_not_down`, logical (node type indicator, see below);
- `supply`, integer;
- `groups`, factor (optional; name of a subproblem); and
- ... (hold open the possibility of additional columns for subclasses).

Rules/conventions:

-  This document terms "node labels" the row names of a `NodeInfo` table.
-  Multiple subproblems' node information can be combined into a single `NodeInfo` object.
-  Ordinarily a `NodeInfo`'s `name` column and its node labels are the same.
   The reason for the presence of both is to avoid duplication among node labels,
   which might otherwise occur when a `NodeInfo` arises by concatenation of solutions
   to distinct matching problems (which so happened to involve distinct units
   that shared names).
-  Within levels of `groups`, values of `name` should be unique.  (Presently the validity
   checker only looks for this when `groups` has a single level, in the interests of avoiding
   slowdowns when combining NodeInfo's.)
-  Coding of node types in `upstream_not_down` column: `TRUE ~` upstream, i.e.
   "T(**f**)" nodes in Fig. 2 of H.&K. '06, `FALSE ~` downstream or "C(**f**)"
   nodes in H.&K. '06 Fig. 2; `NA ~`  bookkeeping nodes, e.g. "Overflow" or "Sink"
   in H.&K. '06 Fig. 2.
-  A node's `price` can be `NA_real_`, but only if `upstream_not_down=FALSE`.  See also Rules/conventions pertaining to `MCFSolutions` objects, below.
- This type's validity checker should be fast, eschewing expensive operations.
- If the solver operated on a transformation of the distance, it's the correspondingly back-transformed node prices that are stored in the `NodeInfo`.

### `ArcInfo`

An `ArcInfo` has 2 slots:

- `@matches`, data frame with columns
    + `groups`, factor,
    + `upstream`, factor,
    + `downstream`, factor;
- `@bookkeeping`, data frame with columns
    + `groups`, factor,
    + `start`, factor,
    + `end`, factor,
    + `flow`, integer (nonnegative),
    + `capacity`, integer (nonnegative).

Rules/conventions:

- In terms of the network flow solution, presence of a row in `@matches` encodes a corresponding flow of 1; absence encodes flow 0.  (So having the row means its `upstream`/`start` node and `downstream`/`end` nodes were matched, absence means not matched.)
- The factors `upstream`, `downstream`, `start` and `end` all have the same `levels()`.
- Arcs involving bookkeeping nodes have lower capacity 0, upper capacity `capacity`. Their `flow` values must fall in this range (inclusive of endpoints).
- This type's validity checker should be fast, eschewing expensive operations.
- The `@bookkeeping` d.f. must have a row for each of the bookkeeping arcs of the problem.
- Each (`groups`, `upstream`) pair must appear as a (`groups`, `name`) pair in the NodeInfo table, with `upstream_not_down==TRUE`; each (`groups`, `downstream`) pair must appear as a (`groups`, `name`) NodeInfo  pair, with `upstream_not_down==FALSE`.
- Similarly a (`groups`, `start`) or (`groups`, `end`) pair carried in this table must have in the NodeInfo table a corresponding (`groups`, `name`) entry.



## Primal-dual solution pairs (`MCFSolutions`)

In practice, current plans call only for passing dual solutions
(arrays of node prices), not also primal solutions (flow vectors),
back to the solver.  But in principle the relax4f solver could
accommodate dual-primal pairs as start values, at the cost of rejiggering our
interactions; see comments to issue 162.  Also assessing CS requires the combo
of a primal and dual solution.   So we'll save both of them, as an S4 object.

Slots for class `MCFSolutions`:

- `subproblems`, a "SubProbInfo" object (see above);
- `nodes`, a `NodeInfo` object (see above); and
- `arcs`, a `ArcInfo` object (see above).

Rules/conventions:

- The node-identifying columns of `@arcs` all have precisely the same collection
  of levels (as is enforced by the `ArcInfo` validity checker). In addition, they
  coincide with `row.names(.@nodes)`.  The latter to be enforced by `MCFSolutions`'s
  validity check.
- The `@nodes` table has to have a `groups` column.
- The nodes table will include nodes that don't correspond to any unit
  described in the corresponding match vector: bookkeeping nodes; potentially
  also nodes for units that have been filtered out the match vector.
- It may also include nodes that were not a part of the MCF problem
  presented to the solver.  (B/c e.g.  they
  represent subjects that were were excluded prior to matching, or
  their subproblem was found to be infeasible prior to being sent to
  the solver, they're part of some other subproblem than the one(s)
  currently under consideration.) In this case the corresponding `@node$price`
  value may be `NA_real_` and references to them will not appear
  in corresponding ArcInfo tables.
- Distinct matchable units must not share node labels (values of `row.names(@nodes)`).
- Nor should bookkeeping nodes for distinct subproblems.
- For subjects not appearing in a subproblem that was sent to the
  solver (b/c they were removed from the subproblem first, or b/c their
  subproblem was found to be infeasible), we won't have a record of
  their subgroup or treatment status. OTOH everyone matched will have
  been processed in this way, and for all such subjects the `@nodes`
  table carries an explicit record of their subgroup, which
  `@subproblems` and `@nodes` combine to give row/column or
  treatment/control status via
```r
ifelse(with(object@subproblems, flipped[match(object@nodes$groups,groups)]),
       !object@nodes$upstream_not_down,
       object@nodes$upstream_not_down)
```
- Checking validity for such an object may be moderately expensive
  when the object is large, as it calls for cross-comparison of
  constituent objects. So e.g. `c()` should not routinely check validity
  on its result; rather the check should be applied to smaller objects.
- Hold `@.Data`, `@names` and `@levels` slots for likely future use;
  see below notes re future `Optmatch` S4 class.




### Subtypes for specific matching problems

Different kinds of matching problem have different bookkeeping nodes, implicit arc capacity constraints etc. Encode all this by declaring appropriate subclasses of `MCFSolutions()`.

#### `FullmatchMCFSolutions`

A type extending `MCFSolutions()`, w/ characteristics:

- in `@nodes`, exactly 2 node labels per subproblem s.t. `is.na(upstream_not_down)`: a string beginning with "`(_Sink_)`" and another beginning with "`(_End_)`";
- in `@nodes`, also each of those appears exactly once per subproblem;
- in `@nodes`, each node with `upstream_not_down == TRUE` has positive `supply`;
- in `@nodes`, each node with `upstream_not_down == FALSE` has `supply==0`;
- in `@nodes`, each node with `is.na(upstream_not_down)` has nonpositive `supply`;
- in `@arcs@bookkeeping`, each node with `!is.na(upstream_not_down)` appears as the `start` of an arc that has end node (a string beginning w/) `(_End_)`;
- in `@arcs@bookkeeping`, each node with `upstream_not_down == FALSE` appears as the `start` of an arc that has end node named by a string beginning with `(_Sink_)`.

## Return value of `fullmatch` / `pairmatch` (*ptmatch)

### Immediate plan

Return an object bearing S3 class "optmatch", as we did before these changes.
Embed an `MCFSolutions` into it as an attribute.

### Final solution

Return object of a new S4 class, `Optmatch`, inheriting from factor as well as from `MCFSolutions`.

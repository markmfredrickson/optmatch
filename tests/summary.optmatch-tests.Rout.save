Loading required package: optmatch
You're loading optmatch, by B. Hansen and M. Fredrickson.
 The optmatch package makes essential use of D. P. Bertsekas
 and P. Tseng's RELAX-IV algorithm and code, as well as
 Bertsekas' AUCTION algorithm and code.  Using the software
 to 'satisfy in any part commercial delivery requirements to
 government or industry' requires a special agreement with
 Dr. Bertsekas. For more information, enter
 relaxinfo() at the command line.
